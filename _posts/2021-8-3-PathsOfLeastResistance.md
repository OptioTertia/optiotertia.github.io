To what extent has America's innovation with bits, rather than atoms, since the 1970s a function of increased regulation or a cornucopia of new opportunities?

To what extent is China innovating rather than copying because it is easier or because it lacks creativity?

I shouldn't need to provide any examples beyond the atom bomb to outline that technology is power and those nations with the best technology will dominate. Thus it is crucial to understand the drivers behind technological progress and innovation.

As a brief aside, when I say innovation I mean more science than engineering. Richard Hamming once said: "In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it. In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it." Yes, an idea in and of itself is useless without execution and there are blurred lines where plenty of engineering requires unique solutions to satisfy constraints of the real world [[^AltmanCreativity]]. However, the biggest challenge is going from "Zero to One".

Peter Thiel has argued that the US has stagnated in atoms due to regulation and that China is busy copying and so its creative chops haven't yet been put to the test. I think there are great arguments for both but want to put forward the alternatives (tech opportunities in America and a lack creativity in China) as being additional, important influences.

Bill Gates once said that Microsoft's biggest competitor was Goldman Sachs because they were competing for the highest IQ employees. Independent of regulation, the internet has been and remains in some ways a Wild West with low hanging fruit, and unique advantages for innovation and profiteering in the form of rapid trial and error cycles and zero marginal costs, respectively. This makes me wonder how much of the slow down in atoms has simply been because the highest IQ people are no longer working with atoms. Steve Jobs and Elon Musk may be the two of the only exceptions to this trend and show that yes, it is still possible to make incredible progress with atoms, but it is mighty hard. Again, this is not mutually exclusive with theories of increased regulatory bloat, however, it is more innocuous. Unfortunately, it seems likely to remain the case that one can move faster and make more money by working with bits than atoms.

As for China, I have long grappled with whether or not their educational system, culture, and governmental policies support or hinder innovation. On one hand, the ability to invent a new kind of circuit board should be orthogonal to ones ability to speak freely about Xi Jingping. Moreover, the Chinese government ploughs billions into venture funding and the population's high average IQs, work ethic, and sheer population size mean there are a lot of geniuses present.

However, I believe that humans are bad at compartmentalizing scientific innovation and everyday freedoms. People talk remorsefully about Isaac Newton dedicating so much of his time to alchemy rather than inventing even more of modern mathematics. This is easy to say with 20/20 hindsight but Newton's fascination with both mathematics and alchemy come from the same underlying source of curiosity and his maverick nature. [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/23/kolmogorov-complicity-and-the-parable-of-lightning/) along the same lines writes about how many creative geniuses were burned at the stake by the Church for their iconoclasm. Why couldn't these inventors just keep to their science? Like moths attracted to fire they inherently can't help but be drawn to exploring the flames...

Beyond curiosity being all consuming, China's Confucian values of filial piety, a lack of free speech that Sam Harris once described as "sunlight on bad ideas", and no invisible hand of the market all hamstring Schumpeterian creative destruction and innovation. Finally, [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Conscientiousness-and-online-education) makes the argument that given IQ and conscientiousness are uncorrelated, the more our education and status allocation systems erect additional hoops that require conscientiousness to jump through, the more those in positions for innovation will lack IQ and creativity[[^IQandCreativity]]. Just try to imagine Feynman, Einstein, or Shannon taking all of the extra-curriculars, AP exams and SATs necessary to get into the best universities and stay atop the greasy academic status pole. This weighting on conscientiousness rather than IQ is only more true for China with its formidable gaokao exams. An interesting side point Gwern highlights is that online education will increase demands on conscientiousness...

While on the topic of innovation I want to finish by highlighting the importance of having high variance. Power laws and the classic 80:20 rule, where 20% of your work gives 80% of the returns, apply to innovation and even [stock picking](https://diff.substack.com/p/you-and-your-investment-research) as I recently was surprised to learn. [Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2021/pandemic-progress/) recently talked about America as being a very high variance country with the best and the worst:

> Moreover, it seems clear that the failure in the beginning is related to the triumph in the end: the U.S. remains a dynamic place with more variance than anywhere in the West, which is why you should expect both the highest highs (when there is a clear goal with an uncertain route to success) and the lowest lows (when there is an unclear goal with top down control).

Ben relates this to the pandemic response specifically but I think he means it much more broadly. Contrast this with Anna Sauerbrey's recent dump on Germany, taken from [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/07/why-current-american-politics-is-less-screwed-up-than-you-think.html):

> For all its reasonableness, German politics has been a major failure point over the last twenty (?) years.  The country has a mediocre infrastructure, mediocre primary education system, it is far behind the curve on tech, it is unwilling to pay to defend itself and meet NATO standards, its foreign policy is partly captured by Russia, it is moving away from nuclear power, it responded poorly to the recent floods, it was slow to line up vaccines and relied on awful EU procurement policies, among numerous other failings.  It has enough wealth and accumulated cultural and social capital to withstand these failings, but it has consistently underperformed for some while now.  Matters rarely get settled in an innovative direction and they are masters of complacency and can-kicking.  But at least the major parties do not criticize each other too much.
>
> I would in fact much prefer the policy landscape of the United States, where the two parties are hardly afraid to attack each other, often in the most ridiculous of terms.  Just keep this comparison in mind the next time you despair over the course -- and aesthetics -- of U.S. politics.

Innovation and research is like VC in that it is high risk and high reward with low probabilities of success. There is finite cost to losing 100% of ones investment but almost unlimited upside. Having higher variance in this way can extend to many domains[[^maleIQ]]... but there are some useful caveats outlined in [Applied Divinity Studies](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/asymmetric/):

> The downside of going on a first date isn’t having a mediocre dinner and then getting ghosted. It’s that they become your stalker and you have to get a restraining order. Or that they sexually assault you. Or accuse you of sexually assaulting them.

I think this is where free speech and capitalism come in as a backstop on the maximum downsides. This brings to mind one of my favourite pieces from Gwern, "[Evolution as Backstop for Reinforcement Learning](https://www.gwern.net/Backstop)", which outlines inner and outer optimization loops where in the case of companies, the outer loop is capitalism, in the case of humans doing dumb things, the outer loop is pain. Free speech is the outer loop for... bad ideas? It seems clear that free speech and capitalism enable failing fast and preventing bad draws from the high variance distribution of US outcomes such that the US continues to be the most innovative and stay intact.

Lingering questions:
- How important are first mover advantages? If China can always stay 6 months behind does it not matter if they are the ones innovating?
  - The Atom bomb is a case where first mover advantage was decisive. Telecommunications is a case where leapfrogging over land lines and moving straight to mobile phones may have been an advantage as many Americans remain quagmired in cash or at best credit cards. This isn't to say that having the land lines and sparking the entire internet revolution was not worthwhile, just that there are real path dependencies and the utility of being a first mover can change over different time horizons.
- What makes the US so high variance?
- Is there limited downside to the US's high variance strategy? Does sampling from the bottom of the distribution result in a Minuteman nuke [accidentally detonating](https://smile.amazon.com/Command-Control-Damascus-Accident-Illusion/dp/0143125788?sa-no-redirect=1)?
  - Are there checks and balances in the US that make it more resistant to the downsides? Or have we been lucky to keep rolling 20s?

### Footnotes

[^AltmanCreativity]: I can't remember where but Sam Altman once said it is fruitless to give an uncreative entrepreneur a good startup idea because the big picture idea is insufficient and there will be many smaller but equally important barriers that require creative solutions for the company to be built. The entrepreneur must be creative themselves in order to solve the original challenge of creating a startup idea and all of those that follow.

[^IQandCreativity]: IQ and creativity are correlated. Moreover, it should make sense that if creativity has to do with combining existing things in novel ways, and IQ allows you to better identify patterns, then having a higher IQ gives you both more patterns to work with and more ways in which to combine them.

[^maleIQ]: This higher variance success even can explain why there are so many male professors. To the extent this phenomena is a function of having a high IQ, the normal distribution for male IQs has a higher variance meaning while there are more very dumb men, there are also more incredibly smart ones.
