title:  Paths of Least Resistance
categories: [China, Innovation]
---

- High variance strategies and power laws. How America fits into this and Germany does not.
- Path of least resistance vs barriers. This is for working in bits rather than atoms. And also China copying vs innovating.
- We think innovation can be siloed but in everyday life and thought it can't be.
    - Newton working on alchemy. Scientists being burned at the stake for being too curious. Super curious and high variance. In general the US is selecting too much now for hoop jumping.
    - free speech is sunlight on bad ideas.
        - in addition to lack of free speech lack of free markets.
