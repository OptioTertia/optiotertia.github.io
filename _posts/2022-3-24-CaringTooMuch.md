EAs and those concerned with X-risk would often benefit from caring **less**.

Weighting every spending decision against the life of a child (~$5000 if donated to the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf)) is mentally and emotionally draining [[^GWWC]].

Explicitly working towards a long term terminal goal like "solve AGI" or "prevent all future pandemics" can be so intractably difficult as to make progress impossible. This is only amplified by nightmares of dual-use and information hazards that can easily induce a state of [epistemic learned helplessness](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/03/repost-epistemic-learned-helplessness/).

Unfortunately, it seems like a large proportion of our most impactful innovations have either been (i) stumbling upon nature (penicillin, [taq polymerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taq_polymerase) for PCR, CRISPR) or (ii) found through directionless, whimsical exploration. Feynman, Shannon, and the computer pioneers in [Hackers](https://smile.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396?sa-no-redirect=1) didn't have a specific end goal in mind. To quote computer pioneer [Alan Kay](http://worrydream.com/2017-12-30-alan/) talking about how to fund creative, high impact research:

> I once gave a talk to Disney executives about "new ways to kill the geese that lay the golden eggs". For example, set up deadlines and quotas for the eggs. Make the geese into managers. Make the geese go to meetings to justify their diet and day to day processes. Demand golden coins from the geese rather than eggs. Demand platinum rather than gold. Require that the geese make plans and explain just how they will make the eggs that will be laid. Etc.

Whether this whimsical or chance innovation is bad for catastrophic risks is certainly unclear. However, Adam Marblestone, co-founder of [Focused Research Organizations](https://convergentresearch.org/) (FROs) has talked about the importance of having more levers to pull on the defensive side. It seems too easy to notice the dangers of today's technologies, while taking all of their advantages for granted. After the name of this blog, more technology can give us more third alternatives.

Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Statistical-notes#optimal-existential-risk-reduction-investment) ran simulations of civilizations that tradeoff investing resources in short term x-risk prevention with existing tech versus general tech development:

> For example, Isaac Newtonâ€™s discoveries in astronomy and the laws of motion helped inaugurate threads of work that led directly to space satellites which can watch for asteroids with Earth-crossing orbits. Isaac Newton himself was concerned with x-risk, as he feared that the Great Comet of 1680 would, centuries hence, plunge into the Sun and cause expansion destroying the Earth and humanity. What could Newton have done to directly reduce this x-risk at the time? Absolutely nothing. There were no feasible counter-measures nor any foreseeable technologies which could forestall a comet or protect humanity from the Sun engulfing the Earth; there was not and still is not a mine or bomb shelter deep enough for that. What he could have done is close to what he did do: make fundamental advances in science which posterity could build on and one day be rich and wise enough to do something about the x-risk.

TLDR; matching spending to the probability of x-risk and or spending all on tech dev and then switching later to probability matching are the best two strategies. However, more work should be done on this problem with more sophisticated models!

Paul Bloom has a whole book [Against Empathy](https://smile.amazon.com/Against-Empathy-Case-Rational-Compassion/dp/0062339338?sa-no-redirect=1) related to the concerns of my first paragraph.

[^GWWC]: Taking the Giving What We Can pledge to donate 10% of my annual income to effective charities has been an incredible way to cache my charitable giving. I give my 10% and otherwise don't worry about any other spending.
