What longevity practitioners seem to be missing: the importance of exercise and risks from immunosuppression.

I only know a few people taking deliberate steps to maximize their longevity. However, there are a couple of things that seem suboptimal in their approaches:

**Diet over Exercise:**
- These longevity practitioners are skinny and rarely exercise. I think this is a combination of laziness and calorific restriction where they just lack the energy for it.

- Even in the excellent [Longevity FAQ](https://nintil.com/longevity/) there is a complete lack of info on exercise and its influence on potential aging pathways.

- I'd like to read more about the effects of exercise but I have a strong prior that it is important for increasing cellular repair, apoptosis, cardiovascular health, mitochondrial efficiency(?), and inducing helpful epigenetic modifications.  

- My prior is partly informed by papers by the paper [Running as a Key Lifestyle Medicine for Longevity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28365296/) and its precursor, which claim that "In general, runners have a 25%-40% reduced risk of premature mortality and live approximately 3 years longer than non-runners." and for every hour running you gain 7 hours of life. I haven't read this paper in a while but what is particularly striking is that it is running specifically over other strength or cardio based exercises that confers the most significant benefits.

**Immunological Risks:**

- Longer, more severe infections have immediate effects in suffering, reduced productivity and longer term risks of auto-immune disorders -- the neurological ones are the most concerning and we have likely only just seen the tip of the iceberg here.

- With a number of researchers long suspecting a link between Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis, a few months ago we got [strong causal proof](https://www.jwatch.org/na54567/2022/02/01/strong-evidence-epstein-barr-virus-one-trigger-multiple). EBV looks a lot like the myelin sheaths that wrap around neurons and infection can induce an auto-immune response that leads to multiple sclerosis and it's awful symptoms. What other infections that cause neurological disorders and degeneration are there? Long COVID is particularly topical. Meanwhile, this [paper reviews](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20111598) connections between rapid OCD onset (within 24 to 48 hours!) and strep infections that produce antibodies which inadvertently target a region of our basal ganglia responsible for habit formation. In the paper they summarize another study where:

> A large epidemiologic study of children and adolescents (1,067,743 children <18 years of age followed for 9,620,808 person-years) based on Danish case registers affirmed an association between infections and neuropsychiatric disorders, it did not find specificity of association between particular infections and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Severe infections that required hospitalization were associated with an 84% increase in overall risk of diverse mental disorders. Less severe infections treated with antibiotics were associated with a 40% increase in risk of a mental disorder (20).

- There is additional evidence of links between [Herpes simplex virus and Alzheimers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease#Infections).

- Going back to the [Longevity FAQ](https://nintil.com/longevity/), it is noted that calorific restriction can increase susceptibility to severe infections and that one of the most promising longevity drugs, rapamycin, can lead to immunosuppression:

> Initially, mTOR inhibits the activity of one of the two components of mTOR, mTORC1, and this drives the anti-aging effect. But chronically administered rapamycin eventually inhibits mTORC2 too, and this causes, among others, immunosuppression (which is what rapamycin is commonly used for), which would make people more vulnerable to infectious diseases.

- This makes sense to me because at a fundamental level, having cells focus more on repair and less on replication is antithetical to the production of immune cells necessary to fight infections.

- When performing a cost/benefit analysis of metformin, [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/Longevity#causality-1) highlights side-effects including "Immunologic: Very common (10% or more): Infection (20.5%)" along with a number of others like diarrhea (53%!) and nausea/vomiting (25.5%). These effects bleed into a broader quality of life argument contra longevity interventions. (As a TLDR he concludes the cost benefit is maximized if you start taking it when you are 45 but this of course depends upon your utility function and expect this calculation to change as we collect far more data.)

People are working on forms of rapamycin that don't inhibit immune responses but I think [Chesterton's Fence](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Chesterton%27s_Fence) is strong concerning any longevity based interventions. Especially ones that are as blunt as using small molecules.

Studying animals that don't age or live for super long, SNPs in humans that can boost the odds of living to 100 years by 3x and 1.5x, respectively, and more intensive interventions like parabiosis and cellular reprogramming all seem like more promising, much higher return avenues.
