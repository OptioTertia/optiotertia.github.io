The likes of [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Stagnation) and [Peter Thiel](https://environment.harvard.edu/science-and-democracy-peter-thiel) have compellingly stated that we have had far more progress in bits than we have in atoms. [Ben Horowitz has argued that](https://sotonye.substack.com/p/the-architecture-of-tomorrow-an-interview), a la the a16z phrase "software is eating the world" that there has been so much progress it bits that it is now looping back around to accelerate progress in atoms. A good and timely example of this is [AlphaFold2](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology) and also the mRNA COVID vaccines that were designed in less than 48 hours.

However, as great as our tech is[[^phones]], I have seen two independent instances of commentary that neglect the crucial chokehold that atoms have and will continue to have on our existence.

The first is around crypto regulation and stable coins specifically [[^cryptoRegulation]]. Yes, Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocols a la Bitcoin etc are permissionless and trustless up to a certain extent such that the US government nor any other can shut them down. However, our lives are ultimately dictated by our physical atoms. If the government decides to regulate crypto or ban it there is only so much that can be done and the full potential of cryptocurrency as a medium of payment will be capped at trading virtual assets in Byzantine ways that can evade the IRS. See [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3888752) for more on why the US government is likely to begin regulating stable coins soon.

Similarly, [Balaji in a recent interview](https://sotonye.substack.com/p/if-einstein-had-the-internet-an-interview) stated:

> Put another way, what’s the most powerful force on earth? In the 1800s, God. In the 1900s, the US military. And by the mid-2000s, encryption. Because as Assange put it, no amount of violence can solve certain kinds of math problems. So it doesn’t matter how many nuclear weapons you have; if property or information is secured by cryptography, the state can’t seize it without getting the solution to an equation.

While the latter sentence is true, the former that it tries to link to is not. No matter how much encryption you have, the US government, with its nukes, drones, and tactical strike teams, is and will continue to be the most powerful thing against any entity. As [Mike Tyson said](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-xpm-2012-11-09-sfl-mike-tyson-explains-one-of-his-most-famous-quotes-20121109-story.html) "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."

In the first draft of this post, I began writing that the supremacy of atoms over bits will only fade when we are free from our biological bodies through some form of mind uploading/whole brain emulation. However, even this is not true because the computer chips you are running on will then be the ultimate physical entity from which your lifeblood flows and the dominant vulnerability. It is even interesting to think of the ways in which, while computer chips are easier to maintain than a flesh and blood body, they are also more vulnerable due to having far fewer redundancies and an inability to repair themselves or regenerate in the same way our cells can. Ultimately I think chips can be easier to maintain but this is not guaranteed.

If you buy into this idea that ultimately atoms and physical entities are of primary importance over bits then consider buying land. [Sam Altman has argued](https://moores.samaltman.com/) that in a future AGI world, land will be the only thing that is finite. Given that atoms are the chokepoint of our existence it is also interesting to consider the dramatically outsized valuations that companies dealing with bits have over those handling atoms:

</div>

Due to the zero marginal cost of bits, it makes sense that they can extract more value from their products. Thiel has [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2014/10/10/peter-thiel-on-what-works-at-work/) this discrepancy and these new highly profitable business models that I quote in full:

> Q. What’s a question you always hope you’ll be asked in interviews, but no one ever seems to ask you?
>
> A. There are all these questions about what’s working in Silicon Valley today, what’s not working, that I think are really interesting. There’s something about the software businesses built in the last 30, 40 years that works incredibly well for actually capturing value. And I think it’s interesting to explore how unusual that is relative to many other areas of technology, because there are so many innovations that were good for society but the people who came up with them ended up with very little. The Wright brothers built the first airplane—they didn’t make any money on that.

Under what scenarios will atoms dominate the stock market again?

### Footnotes
* footnotes will be placed here. This line is necessary
{:footnotes}

[^phones]: Thiel goes as far as proposing that our phones are so entertaining they distract us from our shitty transportation systems that have rotted over the last century and from demanding more progress in the realm of atoms.

[^cryptoRegulation]: Tyler Cowen has some great counter arguments for why the US actually is disincentivized from regulating crypto. The most interesting point is that it is in fact **easier** to monitor blockchain transactions for fraud detection etc! As least using existing non privacy oriented protocols.
