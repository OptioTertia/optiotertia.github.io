Too much input and not enough output leads to bloat. Trying to think more clearly through writing and making sense of everything I'm imbibing.

Some favourite quotes: 

> “You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life” -- Winston Churchill

> “It is easy to write. Just sit in front of your typewriter and bleed.” -- Ernest Hemmingway

> “The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not, ‘Eureka! I’ve found it,’ but, ‘That’s funny!''" -- Isaac Asimov

> "If you never fail, you're only trying things that are too easy and playing far below your level." -- Eliezer Yudkowsky

> "Our century is excellent at the production of nightmares and terrible at the interpretation of dreams." -- Anne Boyer
